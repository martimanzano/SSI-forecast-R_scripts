# R scripts for forecasting

R script file including a set of forecasting methods. This script acts as a wrapper of some state of the art forecasting methods, implemented in packages like the well-known **forecast**. Apart from that, it also implements some other useful aspects, like wrapping the **elastic** package to allow easy data gathering from an elasticsearch DB. The script also implements saving and reusing the fitted forecasting models, in order to save time and computation resources.
